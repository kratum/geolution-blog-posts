## LIDAR Data from OpenNRW

#### We will download and prepare LIDAR Data from opengeodata.nrw.de for further use in pdal and CloudCompare

What do we need:
- https://pdal.io/ - One very easy way to get pdal up and running on your system is by using the package manager [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/).

Go to [opengeodata.nrw.de](https://www.opengeodata.nrw.de/produkte/geobasis/dom/dom1l/), select your desired dataset and download it. Inside  your downloaded zip file is a bunch of .xyz ascii files named like this:
- dom1l-fp_32353_5658_1_nw.xyz

__dom1l__ is a german shortname for  _digitales Oberfl√§chenmodell_ and that is like a DSM. Just for the sake of completeness
